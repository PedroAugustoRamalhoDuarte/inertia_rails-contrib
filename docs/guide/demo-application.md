# Demo application

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertiajs.com/login). This application is built using Laravel and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm).

> [!NOTE]
> The Ping CRM demo is hosted on Heroku and the database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, we also maintain a Svelte version of the application, which you can find [on GitHub](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm-svelte).
